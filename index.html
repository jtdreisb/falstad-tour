	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>
	This tour is also available as a stand-alone program that you can use
	without access to the internet.
	<p>
	Try it on <a href=http://falstad.com/circuit>falstad.com</a> website

<div class="toc">Voltage Divider</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Ohm's Law</h2>
	<p>
	This is a demonstration of ohms law
</div>

<div class="toc">Hello</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Adding Components: Simple Diode Circuit</h2>
	<p>
	Here is a demonstration of how to add components to your circuit
	<br>
	Your screen should be blank, now to add some components:
	<br>
	1: move your cursor to any black space, right-click --> Inputs/Outputs --> Add Voltage Source (2-Terminal)
	<br>
	2: click and drag to where you want your voltage source; if you don't like your placement,
	   you can right-click in the black space and click "Select/Drag Selected" so you can move your component
	<br>
	3: Next add a diode (in the Active Components list) and a resistor to your circuit in series
	<br>
	4: To connect your components, you can hit "w" on your keyboard, or right-click and click "wire";
	   Now simply click and drag where you want your wires to go
	<br><br>
	You are now able to add components to any circuit; you can always delete any components on your circuit
	by right-clicking on it and clicking "delete" in the menu
	
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h2>Exporting Circuits: JFET Amplifier</h2>
<p>
Here is a demonstration on how to export the circuits you have made
<br>
We will export this example JFET Amplifier 
<br><br>
After you are done with this circuit (adding components, moving pieces around, etc...), you are ready to export:
<br>
1: move your cursor to any black space in the area where you design your circuits
<br>
2: right-click --> File --> Export
<br>
3: highlight and copy all the information that pops up in the export window, then click "Close"
<br><br>
Now you are ready to import, learn how on the next page
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Importing Circuits: Common BJT Emitter Amplifier</h2>
<p>
Here is a demonstration on how to import the circuits you have made
<br><br>
Now that you have the exported information copied, you are ready to import:
<br>
1: This screen is blank, but we want our JFET Amplifier circuit, so move your cursor to a black area
<br>
2: right-click --> File --> Import
<br>
3: paste the information into the import box and click "Import"
<br><br>  
Now your circuit should appear in the circuit design, just as you had it before, ready to be edited once again
<br><br><br>
We are now going to use this imported JFET Amplifier circuit and modify it to make a BJT Amplifier:
