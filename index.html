	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	
	<p> This tour of the falstad circuit simulator was developed for Jeff Gerfen's EE-346 Laboratory Final Project by 
	<ul>
		<li> Jason Dreisbach
		<li> Jonathan Brophy
		<li> Matthew Crussel
	</ul>
	<p> This simulator was originally developed by <a href=http://falstad.com>Paul Falstad</a> and requires a java runtime.
	<p> After working through this walkthrough try the simulator on <a href=http://falstad.com/circuit>falstad.com</a>
	<p> Good Luck!

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Introduction<h2> <h4>AC Summing Circuit</h4>
	<p>
	The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a basic understanding of the various 	tools available to you with the Falstad Circuit simulator.
	<p>
	A negative voltage is indicated by a red color, where a positive is green. Moving yellow dots indicate current.
	<p>
	To speed up the simulation, if you want to see the steady state response, you simply need to slide the Simulation speed bar to the right. If you want to slow the simulation down, when viewing a higher frequency AC input, slide the 	Simulation speed bar to the left.
	<p> 
	To speed up or slow down the current animation, move the current bar to the right or left.
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Moving Components<h2> <h3>Ohm's Law</h3>
	<p> When the simulator starts up it defaults to the move/drag mode. Ensure that the simulator is in drag mode by right clicking on a black part of the simulator and verify that the checkmark is next to the menu item titled 'Select/Drag Selected...'
	<p> Try dragging one of the resistors to connect the right branch to ground.
	<p> Note that the current begins to flow once the circuit is completed. Also, the current displayed passing through the wire satisfies the Ohm's Law relationship <code>V=I*R</code></p>
	<p> Next, drag the two remaining resistors into the circuit to complete the left branch of the circuit.
	<p> Confirm that the current passing through both the left and the right branch sum to equal the current provided by the source. 

	<p> Feel free to experiment with different resistor and source values before moving on
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<h2>Adding Components</h2> <h4>Simple Diode Circuit</h4>
	<p>
	Here is a demonstration of how to add components to your circuit
	<p>
	Your screen should be blank, now to add some components:
	<ol>
		<li>
		Move your cursor to any black space, right-click --> Inputs/Outputs --> Add Voltage Source (2-Terminal)
		<li>
		Click and drag to where you want your voltage source; if you don't like your placement, you can right-click in the black space and click "Select/Drag Selected" so you can move your component
		<li>
		Next add a diode (in the Active Components list) and a resistor to your circuit in series
		<li>
		To connect your components, you can hit "w" on your keyboard, or right-click and click "wire"
		<li>
		Now simply click and drag where you want your wires to go
	</ol>
	You are now able to add components to any circuit; you can always delete any components on your circuit
	by right-clicking on it and clicking "delete" in the menu
	
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Editing Component Values<h2> <h4>Integrator Op-Amp</h4>
	<p>
	Here is a demonstration of how to edit component values with an Integrator Circuit
	<p>
	As we can see from the graphs at the bottom of the circuit, the integrator outputs 	the integral of the input AC voltage. Editing component signals is a fairly simple 	process.
	<ol>
		<li>
		Move your cursor over the 80Hz square wave input, right click, and choose edit so we can see various characteristics of the AC wave.
		<li>
		Try changing the Waveform to a triangle wave. You can see how the input and output waves change on the graph.
		<li>
		Now change the frequency to 40 Hz and set the DC offset to 90.
		<li>
		If we set the DC offset to 10, we can see that this Integrator circuit cannot handle the input.
	</ol>
	<p>
	All of the components in the simulator can be edited in this way.
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<h2>Reading Component Values</h2> <h4>Wave Rectifier</h4>
	<p>
	Here is a demonstration of how to read component values with a Wave Rectifier.
	<ol>
		<li>
		First we want to slow down the simulation, Drag the simulation speed bar to the left until you can observe the simulation time moving at about .01ms/ second
		<li>
		Put your cursor over the load resistance. The simulator provides the current, voltage drop, resistance value and power dissapation of the component.
		<li>
		Now speed up the simulation and put your cursor over any of the diodes. When the voltage across the diode is below about .6V, the current is 0
	</ol>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Exporting Circuits</h2> <h4>JFET Amplifier</h4>
	<p>
	Here is a demonstration on how to export the circuits you have made.
	<p>
	We will export this example JFET Amplifier. 
	<p>
	After you are done with this circuit (adding components, moving pieces around, etc...), you are ready to export:
	<ol>
		<li>
		Move your cursor to any black space in the area where you design your circuits
		<li>
		Right-click->File->Export
		<li>
		Highlight and copy all the information that pops up in the export window, then click "Close"
	</ol>
	Now you are ready to import, learn how on the next page
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Importing Circuits</h2> <h4>Common Emitter BJT Amplifier</h4>
	<p>
	Now that you have the exported information copied as described in the last slide, you are ready to import:
	<ol>
		<li>
		This screen is blank, but we want our JFET Amplifier circuit, so move your cursor to a black area
		<li>
		Right-click->File->Import
		<li>
		Paste the information into the import box and click "Import"
	</ol>
	Now your circuit should appear in the circuit design, just as you had it before, ready to be edited once again
	<p>
	We are now going to use this imported JFET Amplifier circuit and modify it to make a BJT Amplifier:
	<ol>
		<li>
		First, delete the JFET, and add a BJT in its place (NPN type), also delete the 1uF and 100uF capacitors
		<li>
		Move the 50k ohm resistor to connect to the base of the BJT and ground, also add another resistor connecting the 10V 
		   source and the base of the BJT
		<li>
		Now connect the "out" terminal to the collector of the BJT
		<li>
		Place wire if there are any other missing connections in your circuit
		<li>
		You now have a sample BJT circuit, feel free add, delete, and move components as you please, as well as edit their values
	</ol>
